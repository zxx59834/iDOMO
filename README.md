# iDOMO
 This package is developed to rank drug combinations reversing a disease signature and 2 drug-induced gene signatures. Combination therapy has become increasingly important for treating complex diseases which often involve multiple pathways and targets. However, experimental screening of drug combinations is costly and time-consuming. The availability of large-scale transcriptomic datasets (e.g., CMap and LINCS) from in vitro drug treatment experiments makes it possible to computationally predict drug combinations with synergistic effects. Towards this end, we develop a computational approach, termed Identification of Drug Combinations via Multi-Set Operations (iDOMO), to predict drug synergy based on multi-set operations of drug and disease gene signatures. iDOMO evaluates the synergistic effect of a pair of drugs by the combinationâ€™s beneficial and detrimental effects.
